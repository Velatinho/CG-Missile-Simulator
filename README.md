# Rocket Simulator

Task: Design a simulator of a point-to-point missile in a 3D landscape. The point of view must be in third-person.
The missile must follow a parabolic-like trajectory and its orientation must be interpolated accordingly.

The user is able to rotate and zoom the camera view, change the direction of the light, change the speed and the height of the animation and apply different textures to the background.
